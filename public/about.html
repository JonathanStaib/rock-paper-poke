            The A-team came together in the Autumn on 2022. They met through the
            Code Fellows web development boot camp. Bringing their experience
            and knowledge from different corners of the country to build the
            final group project for the 201 course. There are many teams, but we
            are the A-team. <br />"I love when a plan comes together" - Lewis
